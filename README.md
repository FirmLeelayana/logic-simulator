# Logic Simulation Project
The main focus of this project is to develop a fully working logic simulation program using Python, with heavy emphasis on OOP, unit testing, version control, and good software development practices. The project involves all major phases of software engineering practice, from specification, design, implementation, to testing and maintenance. The end product is a fully usable logic simulator program with a working GUI that users can play with to simulate a logical sequence over a series of time steps. The users will need to specify their desired circuit via our pre-specified EBNF syntax languange in a circuit definition file, which can then be selected in the logic simulator program itself. 

The main tasks in this software development process involves implementing the Names, Scanner, Parser, and GUI classes, and to write corresponding unit tests for each of the classes with good coverage.

The below image demonstrates the main phases involved in using this logic simulator program:
